    "**Summary:** An introductory tutorial to get things started with single cell RNA-seq analysis. This tutorial will describe the basic steps in a single cell RNA-seq analysis workflow including cell and gene quality control, normalization, batch correction, selection of highly variable genes, and visualization. Once described, we will leverage these techniques to identify and characterize T cell subsets and determine differences in these populations that result from virus infection.\n",

    "One benefit of the increased popularity of single cell RNA-seq is the release of a plentiful numbers of organism and cell type specific datasets. For this workshop, we'll be using a dataset provided by Zanini et al. from their paper [Virus-inclusive single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the molecular signature of progression to severe dengue](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813819115).\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, blood samples were collected from four healthy controls and six individuals who presenting to a Colombian hospital and met criteria for dengue virus infection. Two of the dengue-infected patients experienced an uncomplicated disease course characterized by flu-like symptoms while the other four experienced severe dengue manifestions.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted and FACS was performed to enrich various broad immune cell types and sort single cells in 384 well plates for a modified 5'-RACE RNA-seq library preparation.

    "# Loading the data\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is load the data. In this case, it is provided as an .hdf5 file which, when loaded, represents an AnnData object. This is the format used by the Scanpy library which we'll be using for the majority of this analysis. This object can be thought of as a data matrix in which the rows and columns can be annotated with user-supplied or -generated metadata. A graphical representation is displayed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![AnnData Description](https://falexwolf.de/img/scanpy/anndata.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This format can be used to organize single cell RNA-seq data. The data matrix (.X field) represents the count data itself, where the number of counts for a specific gene are recorded in each column for every cell, represented by a row:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Gene | Cell_1 | Cell_2 | Cell_3 |\n",
    "| ---- | ------ | ------ | -------|\n",
    "| SNORA74 | 1 | 2 | 3 |   \n",
    "| CCDC144B | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n",
    "| LINC00430 | 0 | 1 | 0 |    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual cell annotions are found in the \".obs\" field. We can add annotations like, what sample a cell belongs to, or what cell type it is, etc. Gene annotations are likewise found in the \".var\" field. Unstructured annotations, those not pertaining to a specific gene or cell but to the whole dataset, are provided in the \".uns\" field. Anndata objects can also contain multiple layers, which are alternatives to the \".X\" field. For instance, when we log normalize our data as part of preprocessing, we can save the original raw count data as a layer for easy access later. The alternative layers can be accessed through the \".layer\" dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these fields, including the \".X\" data matrix, are accessible in the same was as a pandas DataFrames with `.loc` and `.iloc` indexing. Subsetting the AnnData object will also subset its elements accordingly, so an operations like `anndata[list_of_genes,:]` will subset \".X\", \".obs\", and any layers you've created."

    "## Normalization\n",
    "Currently, the data we've been working with is represented as counts which are representative of the molecules which were captured in the single cell RNA-seq experiment. Given that the RNA-seq experiment is a random sampling of mRNA in a cell, the number of counts detected in a cell is a function of both the actual number of transcripts in a cell and the capture efficiency of those transcripts. We must then estimate the actual number of transcripts in a cell to be able to compare expression values between cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We call the estimated number of transcripts in a cell the *size factor* of a cell. Normalized expression values for a cell can be determine by dividing the measured counts by the size factor of a cell. To calculate these size factors we'll use an approach implemented in *computeSizeFactors* function of the *scran* R package. In brief, this method computes a size factor for clusters of similar cells and then determines cell size factors by deconvoluting the cluster-based size factors. Many alternative methods exist, but a comparison performed by [Büttner et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0254-1) found it to perform best.\n",
    "\n",

Enough genes need to be retains so as not to lose any biological signal, but not too many genes that noise is included from irrelevent genes. A number of strategies can be employed to determine the optimal amount (see [here](https://osca.bioconductor.org/feature-selection.html#hvg-selection)), but for our purposes we'll just select the top *n* genes.

    "We generally see the same genes that were upregulated in the CD8 cells upregulated in the activated CD4 cells. This might provide evidence for the cytokine storm but, given that the same genes were upregulated in both clusters, it might just be a result of a batch effect between the samples. It could also be argued that the inteferon response genes are upregulated because of the increased viremia associated with severe dengue. More evidence is obviously needed in either case. Explore the `cd8_df` and `cd4_df` dataframes to look at what other genes are upregulated.\n",

Despite the high number of dengue infections across the world, there are no biomarkers to predict disease progression. Looking at expression in this manner is the first step in identifying which immune factors might be a good targets."

    "# Summary:\n",
    "In this tutorial we went throught the typical steps of a scRNA-seq analysis workflow. We started with general preprocessing of the data which included cell and gene quality control, normalization, batch correction, selection of highly variable genes, and visualization. In these steps we explored the data and filtered it so as to conservatively remove low quality data and optimize downstream analysis results. In downstream analyses we selected T cells through clustering, and characterized T cell subsets through subclustering and differentialy gene analysis. We then used these characterized T cell subsets to inform our analysis of dengue virus infection using compositional analysis and differential gene expression. "
